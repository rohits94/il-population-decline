# il-population-decline



In this project, I worked with a corpus of news articles (over 400K) . The articles are related to either the city of Chicago, the state of Illinois, or both.

The goal of this analysis was two-fold: first, to use NLP techniques to identify some of the key factors influencing Illinois' declining population, and second to  provide actionable recommendations on how this trend can be reversed.
